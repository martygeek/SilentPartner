# SilentPartner

This doesn't do much.  Really.
It listens, it analyzes what speech it can find, and then offers (usually) snarky commentary in the form of GIFs

This is just for fun. I put together a SpecchRcognition listener and tied it with a Giphy integration.  As you speak, it listens and displays an appropriate GIF
